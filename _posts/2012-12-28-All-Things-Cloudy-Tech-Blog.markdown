Hi there,
This is a new blog focussed purely on technology issues around building cloud-scale, distributed systems. 
We share our perspectives, challenges regarding building and running software at scale. In some detail, we
balance our decisions based on the three dimensions of the CAP theorem and how we reach compromises to meet
customer experience and product requirements while still building the best product to run our cloud services.

We intend to use this blog to share the details of our approach and technical challenges along the way that 
we encountered and solved.Thank you for reading and participating in the conversation!

All Things Cloudy Engineering team.
