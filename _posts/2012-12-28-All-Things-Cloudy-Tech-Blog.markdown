Hi there,
This is a new blog focussed purely on technology issues around building cloud-scale, distributed systems. 
We share our perspectives, challenges regarding building and running software at scale. We balance our 
decisions based on the three dimensions of the CAP theorem and how we reach compromises to meet
customer experience. 

We intend to use this blog to share the details of our approach and technical challenges along the way that 
we encountered and solved.Thank you for reading and participating in the conversation!

We want to do a special shout out for a couple of tools we used to setup this blog. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is a static site 
generator and our search for a minimalistic theme ended with the [left](https://github.com/holman/left#readme) theme.
