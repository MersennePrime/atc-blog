    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2> Learnings from building distributed, eventually consistent systems that scale. </h2>

    <p>All Things Cloudy is a digital stage to share our perspectives, 
    interesting learnings and challenges that we have overcome in building 
    large scale, distributed software. This is an independent blog focussed 
    purely on technology and there is no direct or implied association about 
    the technical problems and perspectives of our current or past employers. 
    We have been hacking and building distributed systems for years and want 
    to capture our learnings, details of approaches we've taken to solve technical 
    challenges we face. In some cases, the blog takes on fictional startup 
    initiatives and attempts to build the infrastructure and software stack to 
    support that initiative. </p>
